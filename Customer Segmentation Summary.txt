there is a retail channel, and then there is another channel which consists of hotel/restaurant or cafe. Similarly, there are 3 regions; there is Lisnon, 
Oporto or another particular channel.

Insights:
1) There are a couple of customers in Cluster3 who spend a lot on milk, in this case. And they seem to be spending low on grocery; but they are spending high on the product 'fresh' as well. These customers will cater to customers who spend high on milk and fresh which spend low on groceries.

2) Customers who spend a lot on milk and on grocery also seem to be spending a lot on detergents paper. Cluster6 & Cluster7 people follow this trend and they belong to either
of Region 2 or 3.

3) Customer in Cluster4 spend high on fresh products and are not from Hotel/Restaurant or cafe where Fresh products are required on daily basis. Customers from these clusters
belong mostly from Region1.
